## Github commands

Github commands I have learned and what are the usage of them:

- [git version] - to verify Git was installed on your computer termina
- [Git Clone] - is used for just downloading exactly what is currently on the remote repository and saving it in your machine's folder where that project is placed. (Only one time)
- [git fetch] - is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository
without bringing the changes into the local repository.

- [git pull] -  downloads the changes and merges them into your current branch. (Can be multiple time if there is new
changes on the branch in the repo)
- [git add] - Stage the all the file for commit to your local repository by the following command.
- [git commit -m "Create changes on README file"] - Commit the file that youâ€™ve staged in your local repository.
- [git push origin main] - Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub
